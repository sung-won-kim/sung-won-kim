### Hi, I'm Sungwon Kim. 👋 

Hi, I’m an Ph.D. student in the **Graduate School of Data Science at KAIST** ([Data Science & Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (DSAIL)](http://dsail.kaist.ac.kr/)), led by Prof. Chanyoung Park.  

I am primarily focused on data mining and machine learning, with a particular interest in graph data analysis. 
My research is driven by exploring data-efficient methods that not only leverage the powerful performance of deep learning but also maintain applicability to training and inference time when applied to real-world scenarios.

## Interest
- Graph Neural Networks
  - Learning-based 3D Simulation via GNN 
  - Federated Learning
  - Data-Efficient Deep Learning
- Anything related to the tasks that can be addressed in real-world scenarios!
